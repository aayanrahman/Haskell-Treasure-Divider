# Cyber Booty: Pirate Treasure Divider

Cyber Booty is a next-gen treasure division protocol built for pirates to fairly distribute their loot. Using clever data structures and algorithms, the application ensures that the distribution is proportional to the priorities of each crewmember.

## What it Does
- Allows users to input treasures (e.g., gems, gold, diamonds) into the Treasure Vault.
- Enables crew management by adding, editing, and deleting crewmembers, each with a defined priority.
- Calculates a fair distribution of treasure based on crewmember priorities using an algorithm that rewards higher priority members with larger shares.
- Presents the Distribution Matrix, displaying each pirate's share in an intuitive, holographic style.
- Whether you're dividing loot from a grand voyage or a digital hackathon, Cyber Booty ensures fairness and precision for every pirate crew.
